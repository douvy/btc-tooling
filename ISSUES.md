# Bitcoin Order Book Implementation Plan

This document outlines an iterative approach to implementing the Order Book component based on the specification in Spec.md. Each iteration builds upon the previous one while ensuring the application remains functional throughout development.

## Iteration 1: Basic Structure and Layout
- Create the basic OrderBook component structure
- Implement static UI layout with hardcoded sample data
- Add amount control display (non-functional)
- Style the component with proper colors and spacing
- Ensure responsive design (desktop/mobile views)

## Iteration 2: Amount Controls Functionality
- Implement decrement/increment buttons for the BTC amount
- Add validation for direct numerical input
- Follow amount sequence per specification:
  - Decreasing: 0.05 → 0.01
  - Increasing: 0.05 → 0.1 → 0.5 → 1 → 2.5 → 5 → 10

## Iteration 3: Exchange Selection
- Add exchange selection tabs (Bitfinex, Coinbase, Binance)
- Default to Bitfinex
- Implement tab switching UI with smooth transitions
- Maintain appropriate state management for selections

## Iteration 4: WebSocket Integration (Bitfinex)
- Create WebSocket connection to Bitfinex
- Implement data processing for order book format
- Update component to use real data when available
- Maintain static data as fallback
- Add connection status indicator

## Iteration 5: Hover Interactions
- Add tooltip functionality on hover showing:
  - Cumulative size
  - Total value in USD
  - Percentage of visible book
- Ensure smooth hover experience

## Iteration 6: Performance Optimization
- Implement efficient updates (only changed values)
- Add FPS limiting (5 fps as per spec)
- Batch visual updates
- Optimize for smooth animations

## Iteration 7: Additional Exchange WebSockets
- Add Coinbase WebSocket integration
- Add Binance WebSocket integration
- Ensure proper data format conversion for each exchange
- Test switching between exchanges

## Iteration 8: Error Handling & Fallbacks
- Implement reconnection logic
- Add clear "Disconnected" indicator
- Create REST API fallback for when WebSockets fail
- Implement graceful fallback to cached data

## Iteration 9: Mobile Optimization
- Refine mobile view with fewer visible orders
- Optimize touch targets for mobile
- Test on various device sizes

## Iteration 10: Testing & Refinement
- Write unit tests for core functionality
- Perform thorough testing with real exchange data
- Fix any bugs or edge cases
- Polish UI animations and transitions

Each iteration provides a complete, working feature or enhancement while maintaining application stability. This approach allows for regular testing and feedback throughout the development process.

# RSS Feed Integration for BTC Analysis

This feature adds integration with HestiaAI's Substack RSS feed to display Bitcoin market analysis directly in the dashboard.

## How It Works

1. The application fetches the RSS feed from HestiaAI's Substack
2. Parses the feed to find posts titled "Comprehensive Big-Picture Analysis"
3. Extracts just the key bullet points:
   - BTC Price
   - Macro Environment
   - Sentiment
4. Displays these bullet points in the BTC Analysis component

## Technical Implementation

- Created a Next.js API route at `/api/substack` that fetches and processes the RSS feed
- Uses regex-based parsing instead of XML libraries for better compatibility with serverless environments
- Implements caching with hourly revalidation to minimize API calls
- Includes robust error handling and fallback content

## Future Improvements

- Add click-through to the original Substack post
- Implement server-side rendering for better SEO
- Add analytics to track popular analysis points
- Consider adding more sections from the analysis

## Component Usage

The BTC Analysis component is placed in the right sidebar above the Twitter feed component.

```tsx
<BTCAnalysis 
  date="APR 7, 2025"
  content={analysisContent}
/>
```

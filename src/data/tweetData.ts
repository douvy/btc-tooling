    text: "I know many people really really want this to be like 2021 for $BTC bc they want entries. Mistakes have been made in allocation. But the difference is. The very day we topped in 2021 CPI had come in at an astronomical number. We topped right there. It was quite obvious at the time we had runway inflation and the Fed would be forced to hike rates in the near future, and potentially even begin QT. Markets would begin to go risk off \n\nThis time, interest rates are high, inflation is tamed The US is discussing outgrowing it's debt. You can't compare these two situations bc they aren't the same at all. The only similarity is on the chart where there was a dip, it took out the highs. But even these are no longer the same as prev it took out the highs and then essentially immediately started a down trend lining up with the catayst. This time, we continue to consolidate above the prev aths while treasury companies go all in. This is a problem for a later date, but not today imo",
